UAC's Doomed Raiders

It's a mod for Zandronum 3.0, primarily focused on co-op and being Terry-themed and stuff, I guess.

Not all resources here will be used in the main project, pieces can be cloned and downloaded as zip files for use in the game using either a batch file, your favorite launcher e.g. ZDL, yeah. That's all I can think of for now -Jim Flannigan

Note to Github staff: parts of this project ARE NSFW, if that is a problem please contact me about pulling anything I have to. If there is a way to mark this as NSFW so minors can't view the content of it, please let me know, thanks!
