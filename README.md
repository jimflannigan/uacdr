UAC's Doomed Raiders

It's a mod for Zandronum 3.0, primarily focused on co-op and stuff, I guess.

Not all resources here will be used in the main project, pieces can be cloned and downloaded as zip files for use in the game using either a batch file, your favorite launcher e.g. ZDL, yeah. That's all I can think of for now -Jim Flannigan
